<h1>Visualize Campari</h1>

<p>
These scripts are designed to take in a directory where raw Campari data was generated an then generate a basic presentation, to visualize the data.
</p>
<p>
It accomplishes this using Shell Scripting, Python, Matlab, and the OpenOffice API (UNO).
</p>

<p>
This project is far from complete, and there is a lot left to do. Some of the things planned include:
<ol>
<li>Finish graphing the possible output files from Campari using the most default methods possible.</li>
<li>Add proper titles to the slides for each graphic in the presentation</li>
<li>Condense very similar graphs that relate to each other onto single slides</li>
<li>Create a method to allow people to have a key file specifying what parts of the Campari data they want in their output presentation.</li>
</ol>
</p>
